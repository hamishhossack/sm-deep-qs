# SM interview

We will run through a series of questions, some theory, some practical. Our aim is to asses your knowledge and ability to solve problems in real time.

We are not looking for 100% answers, we might move on early if we think the question isn't right or a different avenue is taken.

It's to gage an overall skill and understanding of technologies we use at SimpleMachines.

## Time

We have 1 hour for completion, however the last question is very broad which would cover many areas. We want you to showcase your knowledge and ability and impress us with your favourite architectures.
